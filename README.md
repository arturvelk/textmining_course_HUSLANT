 ## data acquisiton
The data acquisiton folder contains the scraping scripts and the video conversion and trimming scripts (the 24.hu scraper is missing for a reason I dont remember). These result in the text data of the three online media dataframes and the audio files only with the speech of MZP which i transcribed with the help of AIrite.

The corpus creation ipynb contains the code which transformed and merged the datas of the three different media portals and the joining of the text data of the audio files.

## Main
Here the corpus.r file contains the raw version of the corpus demosntration and the rmd and html contain a leaner version.
